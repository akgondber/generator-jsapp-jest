> Js app generator (almost clean + jest devDependency)

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-jsapp-jest using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-jsapp-jest
```

Then generate your new project:

```sh
$ yo jsapp-jest
```

The generator uses [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) package manager by default, in order to use npm you can provide `--use-npm` option:

```sh
$ yo jsapp-jest --use-npm
```
